Elements often have associated attributes. Some elements require
 attributes to function. Take the <img> tag used to display an
 image. The tag is self-closing so a perfectly valid implementation
 would be </img>. However, in the browser, this will display
 nothing. An <img> needs a source location attribute to point
 to where the image is stored. This is supplied by src attribute.
 This is where you include the path to the image you want to
 display. The image can live on your machine, or it can be a URL
 to another web page, or even another website.

     <h1>My Great Page</h1>
     <img src="img/jazzCats.jpg" />
